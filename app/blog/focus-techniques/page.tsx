            While the Pomodoro Technique forms a solid foundation for productivity,
            combining it with other focus methods can create an unstoppable workflow.
            Let's explore proven techniques that complement your Pomodoro practice.
          </p>

          <h2>Time-Boxing Your Tasks</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond the standard Pomodoro intervals, time-boxing involves allocating
            specific time blocks to particular tasks. This method helps prevent
            scope creep and maintains clear boundaries between different types of work.
          </p>

          <h2>The 2-Minute Rule</h2>
          <p>
            If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately instead of
            adding it to your Pomodoro queue. This prevents the accumulation of
            small tasks that can clutter your mind and break your focus.
          </p>

          <h2>Mindful Transitions</h2>
          <p>
            Use the Pomodoro breaks mindfully. Instead of reaching for your phone,
            try quick meditation, stretching, or deep breathing exercises. This
            helps maintain mental clarity between focus sessions.
          </p>

          <h2>Task Batching</h2>
          <p>
            Group similar tasks together and tackle them in dedicated Pomodoro
            sessions. This reduces the mental load of context switching and helps
            maintain deeper focus.
          </p>

          <h2>The MIT (Most Important Task) Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Each evening, identify your three most important tasks for the next
            dayâ€”ranked by priority. The next day, start your Pomodoro sessions
            by tackling the first task. Simple. Effective. Game-changing.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts: Build Your Ultimate Focus Stack</h2>
          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is your foundationâ€”but by layering these
            additional methods, you can build an elite focus system tailored to
            your life. Productivity isn't about doing moreâ€”it's about doing
            what matters with intention and energy.
